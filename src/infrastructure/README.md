# Infrastructure Layer

This directory contains implementations of interfaces defined in the domain layer and external concerns.

## Purpose

The Infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations for:

- External services and APIs
- Databases and data access
- Frameworks and libraries
- Server and network communication

## Guidelines

- Infrastructure code should implement interfaces defined in the domain layer
- Keep implementation details isolated from domain and application layers
- Use dependency injection to provide infrastructure implementations to higher layers
- Adapt external libraries and frameworks to fit the application's needs
