# Utils

This directory contains utility functions and helpers used across the application.

## Purpose

The Utils directory provides:

- Helper functions that are used by multiple layers
- Common utilities that don't fit into a specific layer
- Shared code that doesn't contain business logic

## Guidelines

- Utility functions should be pure and have no side effects
- Keep utilities focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid placing business logic in utilities
- Document utilities thoroughly for reuse
