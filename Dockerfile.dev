# We don't copy src here because we'll mount it as a volume
# This allows for hot reloading without rebuilding the container

# Set NODE_ENV to development
ENV NODE_ENV=development

# Expose port if needed (though MCP server uses stdio)
# EXPOSE 3000

# Start the server in development mode with hot reloading
# Using nodemon directly for better control
